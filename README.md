# docker-musl-cross

  This repository contains a `Dockerfile` that builds an image with the
  [musl-cross][1] toolchain installed.  I will attempt to keep the version
  of musl up-to-date.

  This image is also an automated build on the Docker hub - you can fetch it
  by running: `docker pull andrewd/musl-cross`
